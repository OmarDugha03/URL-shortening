# URL Shortening Service

A simple URL shortening service built with Next.js, MongoDB, and NextAuth.

## Functionality 
- **Shorten URLs**: Enter a long URL into the service, and it will return the origin  URL.
- **Redirect**: When users visit a shortened URL, they are redirected to the original long URL.
- **CRUD Operations**: Users can create, read, update, and delete shortened URLs as needed.
